**Project Idea: Build-Your-Own Burger React App**

**Description:**
Create an interactive Build-Your-Own Burger application using React. This project incorporates various React concepts such as state management with `useState`, handling side effects with `useEffect`, and creating a visually appealing layout using CSS techniques like flexbox and grid. Users will be able to customize their burgers with ingredients and dressings and choose a drink to complete their meal.

**Key Features:**

1. **Ingredient Selection:**
   - Display a list of burger ingredients (e.g., buns, patties, lettuce, cheese) as customizable options.
   - Use the `useState` hook to manage the selected ingredients in the burger.

2. **Dressing Options:**
   - Provide options for various dressings (e.g., ketchup, mayo, mustard).
   - Use the `useState` hook to manage the selected dressings for the burger.

3. **Dynamic Burger Preview:**
   - Show a dynamic preview of the burger as the user adds or removes ingredients.
   - Utilize React components to represent different burger layers.

4. **Drink Selection:**
   - Include a section for users to choose a drink to accompany their burger.
   - Use the `useState` hook to manage the selected drink.

5. **Total Price Calculation:**
   - Calculate and display the total price of the customized burger and drink based on the selected options.

6. **Reset and Order Button:**
   - Include a button to reset the burger customization and start over.
   - Implement an order button to submit the user's burger order.

7. **CSS Styling:**
   - Apply CSS techniques, such as flexbox and grid, to create an attractive and responsive layout.
   - Use CSS transitions for smooth animations when adding or removing ingredients.

8. **Bonus Features (Optional):**
   - Allow users to choose the cooking style of their patty (e.g., well-done, medium, rare).
   - Implement a visual representation of the burger customization, such as an interactive burger builder.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Setup React App:**
   - Create a new React app using Create React App or your preferred setup.
   - Set up the necessary project structure.

2. **Create Components:**
   - Build components for the burger, ingredient options, dressing options, drink selection, and the dynamic preview.

3. **State Management:**
   - Use the `useState` hook to manage the state of selected ingredients, dressings, and the chosen drink.

4. **Dynamic Preview:**
   - Dynamically update the burger preview based on the selected options.

5. **Price Calculation:**
   - Calculate the total price of the burger and drink based on the selected options.

6. **CSS Styling:**
   - Apply styling to create an appealing and user-friendly interface.

7. **Reset and Order Functionality:**
   - Implement functions to reset the burger customization and handle the order submission.


This Build-Your-Own Burger React App project provides a hands-on opportunity to apply React concepts, enhance user interaction, and create an engaging web application. Users can enjoy the experience of crafting their own virtual burgers with personalized ingredients and dressings, making it a fun and interactive project.


Here's an example of how you can structure the TypeScript code using classes and OOP principles for the Burger App:

```typescript
// Define a base class for menu items
class MenuItem {
  constructor(public name: string, public price: number) {}
}

// Ingredient class extends MenuItem
class Ingredient extends MenuItem {}

// Dressing class extends MenuItem
class Dressing extends MenuItem {}

// Drink class extends MenuItem
class Drink extends MenuItem {}

// Burger class
class Burger {
  ingredients: Ingredient[];
  dressings: Dressing[];
  drink: Drink;

  constructor(ingredients: Ingredient[], dressings: Dressing[], drink: Drink) {
    this.ingredients = ingredients;
    this.dressings = dressings;
    this.drink = drink;
  }

  // Method to calculate the total price of the burger
  calculateTotal(): number {
    const ingredientsTotal = this.ingredients.reduce((total, ingredient) => total + ingredient.price, 0);
    const dressingsTotal = this.dressings.reduce((total, dressing) => total + dressing.price, 0);
    const drinkTotal = this.drink.price;

    return ingredientsTotal + dressingsTotal + drinkTotal;
  }
}

// Mock data for Ingredients
const ingredients: Ingredient[] = [
  new Ingredient('Bun', 1.5),
  new Ingredient('Patty', 3.0),
  new Ingredient('Lettuce', 0.5),
  new Ingredient('Tomato', 0.7),
  new Ingredient('Cheese', 1.0),
];

// Mock data for Dressings
const dressings: Dressing[] = [
  new Dressing('Ketchup', 0.2),
  new Dressing('Mayo', 0.3),
  new Dressing('Mustard', 0.4),
  new Dressing('BBQ Sauce', 0.5),
  new Dressing('Thousand Island', 0.6),
];

// Mock data for Drinks
const drinks: Drink[] = [
  new Drink('Coke', 1.0),
  new Drink('Pepsi', 1.0),
  new Drink('Sprite', 1.0),
  new Drink('Iced Tea', 1.5),
  new Drink('Lemonade', 1.5),
];

// Mock data for Burger
const burger = new Burger(ingredients.slice(0, 3), dressings.slice(0, 2), drinks[0]);

// Calculate and log the total price
const totalPrice = burger.calculateTotal();
console.log(`Total Price: $${totalPrice.toFixed(2)}`);
```

In this example:

- `MenuItem` is a base class with properties common to all menu items.
- `Ingredient`, `Dressing`, and `Drink` are classes that extend `MenuItem`.
- `Burger` is a class representing a burger with arrays of `Ingredient`, `Dressing`, and a single `Drink`.
- The `calculateTotal` method calculates the total price of the burger based on the selected options.
- Mock data is created using instances of these classes.

This structure allows for a more object-oriented approach with classes representing different entities in the burger application.
